<title>a very small programming language</title>


<h3>What is it?</h3>

Calculon is a very simple but very fast programming language designed to be
embedded into other programs. It uses LLVM to generate high-quality machine
code and is ideal for shaders, user-supplied mathematical formulae, etc.

The Calculon language itself is a pure functional language with support for
upvalues, tail recursion, and bindings to the standard maths library. It
supports 3-vectors, reals and booleans as first-class values.


<h3>What's new?</h3>

<b>2014-04-14: Version 0.3 released!</b> Now supporting LLVM 3.3 and Apple OS
X; the language supports multiple return values from scripts, and it's all even
faster!


<h3>Where can I get it?</h3>

<p>Version 0.3 is available for download.</p>
</blockquote>

In addition, you can download
an <a href="../../../tarball/calculon-tip.tar.gz?uuid=tip">the latest version
from the VCS</a>. This is not guaranteed to work, or even to build. I'd
recommend using the formal release above.

Another way of getting the version under development is by
checking out the source repository using <a href="http://fossil-scm.org">the
Fossil DVCS</a>. Use the following commands:

<verbatim>fossil clone http://cowlark.com/calculon calculon.fossil
mkdir calculon
cd calculon
fossil open ../calculon.fossil
</verbatim>

You will need an installation of
<a href="http://llvm.org/releases/download.html#3.3">LLVM 3.3</a>, which does
the heavy lifting. If you're on Debian, install the <code>llvm-3.3-dev</code>
package. If you're on OS X, then Calculon should build cleanly under Homebrew
with the <code>llvm33</code> package installed. If you're on Windows...
Calculon should still work, but you'll have to install LLVM yourself. (If you
make it work on Windows, please get in touch; I'm interested.)

<h3>Why should I use it?</h3>

Calculon is <i>really simple</i>, and <i>really fast</i>.

The Calculon library itself is 4000 lines of C++ and ships as a set of
headers. It can be invoked with one line of setup and three lines per script
you want to load and compile. Then you get a function pointer which you
can just run. Don't take my word for it --- <a href="../demo/fractal.cc">look at
one of the examples</a>.

The Calculon programming language is very simple and is ideally suited to
evaluating mathematical functions, very very quickly. Here is a minimal
Calculon script:

<verbatim>let x = 0;
return</verbatim>

Here is a more complicated one:

<verbatim>
/* On input, A and B are vectors */
/* On output, ANGLE is a real */
let magnitude(V: vector*3) = sqrt((V*V).sum) in
let nA = A / magnitude(A) in
let nB = B / magnitude(B) in
let dot(V1: vector*3, V2: vector*3) = (V1*V2).sum in
let ANGLE = acos(dot(nA, nB)) in
return
</verbatim>

Or if you like, you can do more; one of the sample scripts
<a href="../demo/fractal.cal">calculates the Mandelbrot set</a>.

Calculon can be configured to use either doubles or floats as the native
real type. (You can use both types of Calculon &nbsp;script side-by-side in the
same program.) Vectors are accelerated using SIMD operations where possible.
External functions can be trivially made available to Calculon scripts and you
get most of the standard maths library by default.

Any number of input <i>and</i> output values may be returned.


<h3>Why shouldn't I use it?</h3>

Calculon scripts are <i>pure</i>: they should have no side effects. It's
perfectly possible to register a function which does have side effects, but in
general Calculon is better suited for <i>calculating things</i> rather than
<i>doing things</i>: for example calculating the colour of a pixel, lots of
times, rather than rendering an entire image in one go.

Calculon is <i>not</i> a Turing-complete programming language.

In addition, Calculon is very new and is probably riddled with bugs. Find
any? Let me know by <a href="../../../tktnew">filing a bug</a> (it'll ask you
to log in; you can either create an account or log in as anonymous).


<h3>Who wrote it?</h3>

I, <a href="http://cowlark.com">David Given</a>, wrote it. Got any comments,
criticism, cake? Send it to <a href="mailto:dg@cowlark.com">dg@cowlark.com</a>.
If there's interest, I'll set up a mailing list.


<h3>What's the license?</h3>

Calculon is distributable under the terms of the
<a href="copying.wiki">Simplified BSD License</a>.
