<h3>How do semicolons work?</h3>

Semicolons are syntactically part of the <code>let</code> expression. It works like this:

<verbatim>
let i = 1 ; expr(i)
</verbatim>

The <code>;</code> seperates the <i>definition</i> of the variable or
function from the code which <i>uses</i> the variable or function.

When a Calculon script has multiple let expressions, what's actually happening
is that all expressions after the first are embedded inside the body of the
first. These two equivalent code blocks should make things clearer:

<verbatim>
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
let c = 3;
a + b + c
</verbatim>

<verbatim>
let a = 1; (let b = 2; (let c = 3; (a+b+c)))
</verbatim>

If you prefer, it's possible to think of <code>;</code> as terminating the
definition part of a let expression.
